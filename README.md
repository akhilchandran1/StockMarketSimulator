	Mediator design pattern is used to aid in transaction of shares between Companies and investors.
	Benefit of using this pattern is; it will make easy the transactions of shares between companies and investors.

	This will help to update the shares while trading. If a share is sold by a company, it will be removed from its sharelist. 
	Similarly when an investor purchase a share, this share is added into its sharelist
